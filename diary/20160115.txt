yet another project that i've severely neglected...
definitely want to keep this guy well maintained but far from it...

best to do a status check right now...
ios: v0.9 on app store but that's about it...
 - working on a new 1.0 but it's in a pretty incomplete state on my mba
android: tried to implement it during the nov hackathon but really failed...
python: really just exists as a proof of concept for bi

core features:
- keeping track of current gpa
- notify on upcoming/recent assignments (due/graded)
- cross-platform data backup mechanism

data model:
semester -> course -> criteria -> assignment

desired features:
- syllabus capture
